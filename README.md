# Beachball

Ever written a script and wanted a nice progress indicator, similar to the famous spinning beach ball of death? If so, you've come to the right place.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beachball'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beachball

## Usage

Using Beachball is even simpler than filling up your hard drive with useless crap and then complaining about your technical incompetence to a nerdy friend.

```
spinner = Spinner.new(10)
spinner.start

# intensive things!

spinner.stop
```

## Contributing

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). If you don't respect the license and cargo cult without giving me credit, I probably won't do anything even if I am aware of it (which is highly unlikely). I mean, it took me maybe 20 minutes to write, so stealing isn't that big of a deal. Still though, be nice and do the right thing. If you want to. I don't want to force my subjective opinions down anyone's throat, so if stealing is totally fine in your belief system, who am I to say no? Right? Tolerance for the win.

Haha, just kidding. If you steal my code I will come and kill you.
